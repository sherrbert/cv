  <p>Hello! I am an ELA-teaching "veteran" that has decided to take a career detour into web development. The extent of my web knowledge up until now was coding autoplaying Story of the Year music videos into my Xanga page in the early 2000s. Since then the
    internet has changed and grown a lot, making me want to learn how it all works together and begin building my own websites from scratch. I am also a hobbyist streamer who has taken a breakt in order to focus on this endeavor. </p>

  <h3><a href="favorites.html">My Favorite Things</a></h3>
  <!--  <p>Honestly, I'm not even sure what I should be doing. I want to be a programmer so I can get myself to a point where I no longer feel like this. I hate feeling like this. I hate feeling useless. I hate not being able to do anything. I hate hate hate hate and just want to stop. I want to love myself. I want to look in the mirror and see somebody that I am proud of, see somebody that everyone can be proud of. I don't want to keep living my life with so much hate for myself. I want that to stop. Hopefully this is an avenue I can take to accomplish taht, but I'm not even sure if anything can anymore. What would it take to get me there? What would it actually take to remove all the negative feelings I hold about who I am and what I've done. I want to be useful. I want to be acknowledged. I want this to stop. So I must press forward with this. I must complete this journey and achieve everything I've set forth for myself. I can't keep living like this. I can't keep feeling this way about myself. I just want to stop. </p>
